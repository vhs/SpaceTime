# SpaceTime - Firmware Overview

## Development dependencies

Compiling the firmware requires these dependencies:

-   avr-libc
-   binutils-avr
-   gcc-avr

To install the firmware `avrdude` is required.

You can optionally test/simulate the firmware with `simulavr`.

If `avr-gcc` is in your path, `make` will automatically detect the binary/include/library locations.
